# Acting
Online multiplayer theater system built with Unity and Normcore

Goal is to enable multiple actors to do an improv scene, each using Oculus Quests.  Starting with basic Normcore tutorials to get multiplayer voice chat working.  Had good luck with the basic Normcore drawing tutorial https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/creating-a-multiplayer-drawing-app.html

Next steps:
* Object grabbing
* Locomotion (use OVR Utilities?)
* Avatar customization (change "costumes")

Any help or tips appreciated.
