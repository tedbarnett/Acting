# Acting
Online multiplayer theater system built with Unity and Normcore

Goal is to enable multiple actors to do an improv scene, each using Oculus Quests.  Starting with basic Normcore tutorials to get multiplayer voice chat working.  Had good luck with the basic Normcore drawing tutorial https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/creating-a-multiplayer-drawing-app.html

Completed:
* Normcore VR multiplayer working (basic avatars, with voice chat, mouth movement)
* Implemented mirror (using https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/standard-ar-vr-mirror-shaders-118971)
* Running on Oculus Quest under Unity 2019.2f1

Next steps:
* Touch control button presses for: mirror on/off
* Object grabbing
* Locomotion (use OVR Utilities?)
* Avatar customization (change "costumes")
* Enabling AR viewing of the performance (per https://normcore.io/documentation/guides/using-ar-as-spectator.html)

Any help or tips appreciated.
